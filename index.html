I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly therafter. The next 12 weeks was the best-and most grueling-time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup." </div>

				 <div style="font-size: 15px; font-weight: 500; margin-left: 15px;color: hsl(217, 19%, 35%);">" Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.The agile team project,in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack web developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommended!" </div>
